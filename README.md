# national_governance_frameworks
This holds model, frameworks that integrate various frameworks that are key to the betterment of the nation. Few of the points related to these frameworks are: 

1.	These frameworks are in line to existing national frameworks that can be either overlaid or extended to meet the needs.

2.	Govt as a Service-GaaS, offering GaaS services to its citizens and residents.

3.	Governance models, frameworks and architecture are based on emerging technologies like QAI, Block chain, AGI, ASI, cloud and digital platforms.

4.	An integrated model that allows at least the Govt agencies ay federal and provincial levels to meet the needs, adhere to the international norms and well being.

5.	This model will consume emerging cloud models like public, private, hyper scale, sovereignty, IT+OT, air gapped etc and will have provision for universal plug and play for various newer models, tools and policies.

6.	This lays foundation for the entire national digital and data governance in particular allowing for effective control and security of various CI assets and business engagements 

7.	Various ministries portfolio, approvals, rules, policies will be part of this model that blends with technology making best use of national assets, interest and productivity, measured in terms of RoI, Quality, revenue generated, merits etc.

8.	Also a platform that allows hierarchy data and control flow horizontal and vertical ways using cloud scalability.

9.	Data flows from bottom en mass upwards. Control, policies flow top down. Peers communicate EW and participate in NS traffic. Real time data and control from top monitored by ASI supercomputer makes it possible to catch wrong doings, self goals, public money labeled as private, conversion from black to white etc. All hires, fires, human needs, social needs disparity can be attended in time. National emergency, war situations can be handled at all levels in time and leveraging the last assets to defend nation in time is possible.

10.	Digitalization of paper work, designing redundancy for CI using Digital twins, backups etc can help maintain the integrity of data and lesser false claims.

11.	Cyber threats can be reported in time and counters taken in time.

12.	Border security crossing, smuggling can get real time satellite data and ground public data 

13.	Forecasting of odd events possible using AI, QAI etc


Based on classified taxonomy, develop governance framework that uses cobit, coso, ITIL, Services Iso, services cmm, for use by various Cloud users, corporate staff, investigators, forensic team, analyst, data scientist, allowing them to work on personal data, corporate data, business data, enterprise financial payrolls, allowing staff to build custom pipelines, for Supercomputer that uses all types of functional cross domain details, generates maps, links, relationship, that offers all types of financial transactions and who benefited, who lost opportunity being eligible and why. 

This is investigating wrong doing by people in authority, responsible person using discretionary funds, authority and various non eligible leverages to hire, fire talent, misuse public funds. 

Avoiding all such evils in NexGen Governance and Govt can use this for higher detection of unwanted , daylight robbery by people in authority. Newer automation methods to replace such sensitive areas where humans decision taken the enterprise and country to prosperity or no where

Dual use technology that can help military to use same technology and apps to develop apps and use stack for tailored cloud solutions that can help them understand enemy human related abused, forensic for various crimes, proofs and human rights violations, also for strategy for effective governance in shielding homeland security from cyber threats, abuses, evils. Highly detailed maps and tracking leading to truths, facts and evidences that humans may find it hard to relate and visualise.

Human dignity, value, to be upheld in any case and true democratic values need to be applied irrespective of any attributes. Allowing for better rationale treatment of human actions without bias 

Psychological issues based public actions to be monitored and alerted warned for wrong decisions within few days allowing better second assessments and judgement that are passed in presence of candidate and after allowing him due time to offer proof and motivation behind the action.

When there is clear proof and unacceptable action, such issues need public prosecutor to look into and provide justice and offer measures to remove such authority to be removed from interviewing and further damage to company , public and country at large. There are no frameworks that punish person in authority and with discretionary power , no questions asked, however candidate can open a case to be reviewed by relevant third party. 

Humans need to have a home like environment in Earth and new borns need to have proper life time value as being a human

New field can be derived from terms like intelligent data driven human evaluation, human trial methods, human value evaluation, human life time misuse, abuses of Earthly systems and resources, mismanagement and game theories for coverups, concealing wrong doing, telling lies, misuse of authority and discretionary power. This is foundation for a intelligent real time legal system that can evaluate all life events of all parties and earth related matters
