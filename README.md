# national_governance_frameworks
This holds model, frameworks that integrate various frameworks that are key to the betterment of the nation. Few of the points related to these frameworks are: 

1.	These frameworks are in line to existing national frameworks that can be either overlaid or extended to meet the needs.

2.	Govt as a Company-GaaS, offering GaaS services to its citizens and residents.

3.	Governance models, frameworks and architecture are based on emerging technologies like QAI, Block chain, AGI, ASI, cloud and digital platforms.

4.	An integrated model that allows at least the Govt agencies ay federal and provincial levels to meet the needs, adhere to the international norms and well being.

5.	This model will consume emerging cloud models like public, private, hyper scale, sovereignty, IT+OT, air gapped etc and will have provision for universal plug and play for various newer models, tools and policies.

6.	This lays foundation for the entire national digital and data governance in particular allowing for effective control and security of various CI assets and business engagements 

7.	Various ministries portfolio, approvals, rules, policies will be part of this model that blends with technology making best use of national assets, interest and productivity, measured in terms of RoI, Quality, revenue generated, merits etc.

8.	Also a platform that allows hierarchy data and control flow horizontal and vertical ways using cloud scalability.

9.	Data flows from bottom en mass upwards. Control, policies flow top down. Peers communicate EW and participate in NS traffic. Real time data and control from top monitored by ASI supercomputer makes it possible to catch wrong doings, self goals, public money labeled as private, conversion from black to white etc. All hires, fires, human needs, social needs disparity can be attended in time. National emergency, war situations can be handled at all levels in time and leveraging the last assets to defend nation in time is possible.

10.	Digitalization of paper work, designing redundancy for CI using Digital twins, backups etc can help maintain the integrity of data and lesser false claims.

11.	Cyber threats can be reported in time and counters taken in time.

12.	Border security crossing, smuggling can get real time satellite data and ground public data 

13.	Forecasting of odd events possible using AI, QAI etc
